# Coursera Quiz Scraper
## Intro
Here, I used Python and specifically the **Beautiful Soup** library to scrape data about questions and answers from Coursera's quiz pages and package them into a question set for importing into Quizlet using the import function. </br>
Since I study AI and our K17 course has some new subjects, I had to create new resources for everyone.

## Why code??
- So, between coding to get the resources and manually copying each question one by one to import, which one is more interesting? Of course, coding! Plus, it helps me practice data scraping from websites for analysis, a very essential skill in our AI/DS field. </br>
- In terms of time, doing it manually for one subject might take a day, while coding might take more than a day with bugs and all. But if it's 5 or 10 subjects, you get the idea!! </br>
- I'll continuously update if there are any new subjects so that everyone can learn together. </br>
- Anyways, I wish you all a good time with the resources and high scores on your Final exams. </br>

## Features
- Can extract question content, answer options (both single-choice and multiple-choice), and correct answers. (**Of course, you need to get it right to have the correct answer**)
- Extracts code snippets as well :))
- Extracts essay answers.
- **Coming soon:** Extracts timed questions.

## How to transfer resources to Quizlet
- In the code, I separated questions and answers with `---`, and between two questions, I used `</>`.
- When importing resources into Quizlet, click import and enter them as shown in the image below.

- **Note**: Some questions may have formatting or other issues causing errors when saving resources to Quizlet, so remember to import files one by one to avoid importing everything at once.
